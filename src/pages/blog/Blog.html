            <h1>Fighting poverty by improving health</h1>
            <p>We know for any other thing to be achieved one must be healthy and so our 
                programs focus on health care as primordial and then we carry 
                out community based livelihood, education and Agricultural programs.</p>
            <p class="p1">The most common health issues are physical inactivity and food, 
                obesity, tobacco, substance abuse, AIDS, mental health, falling and injury, environmental quality,
                 immunization, and healthcare access. These all-personal health issues require
                 attention to improve the quality of life and keep you free from diseases</p>

            <h1>Invested in Education</h1>
            <p>Education is the process that facilitates learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, 
                skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. It can significantly
                 alter a person's life and positively affect society. While the value of education cannot be disputed, 
                it is a painful fact that poor people in the community do not have access to it.</p>
    
            <p class="p1">Many poor children need equal access to education. A child's future and
                 personal health are affected when they are unable to acquire quality education.
                  A child's right to education is directly linked to social influences and becoming a threat to society. In this context, children will thrive on leading a better life if they have
                 an education, which will ensure they build hope for the future.</p>
